                <h2 class="title">The World Race</h2>
                <p>This trip changed my life forever. The World Race is an eleven month trip to eleven different countries
                  in which you help the local people with whatever they need assistance with. Some months we helped build schools,
                  other months we taught English. My favorite months were when we would get to walk hut to hut in Africa and help the older
                  generations with their farms.
                </p>
                <p>The countries we traveled to were: Indonesia, Philippians, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bosnia, Kosovo, Romania, Zambia, Lesotho, and 
                  South Africa! 
                </p>
                <p>The most exciting place to me was Ho Chi Mihn City, Vietnam.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Thailand</h2>
                <p>After returning from my trip across the world, I got married and then my wife and I moved to Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
                <p>In Thailand my wife taught English and I worked at a coffee shop. This at times was hard because we didn't speak the language
                  and I had never made coffee before but in the end it was a great experience and I picked up on a few things!

              <h2 class="title">Omaha</h2>
              <p>After almost a year in Thailand we moved home to Omaha, Ne. </p>
              <p>Right now I am doing Covid-19 clean up at a factory in town. It's not the most exciting but it's paying the bills until
                we can eventually go back to our hearts home, Asia!
